A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.

Input:
N = 3
M[][] = {{0 1 0},
         {0 0 0}, 
         {0 1 0}}
Output: 1
Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both
know 1. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity. 

Complexity Analysis: 

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) No extra space is required.


class Solution
{ 
    //Function to find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
    int celebrity(int M[][], int n)
    {
    	int a=0;
    	int b=n-1;
    	
    	while(a<b){
    	    if(M[a][b]==1)
    	        a++;
    	    else{
    	        b--;
    	    }
    	}
    	
    	
    	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    	    if(i!=a && (M[a][i]==1|| M[i][a]==0)){
    	        return -1;
    	    }
    	}
    	return a;
    }
}
